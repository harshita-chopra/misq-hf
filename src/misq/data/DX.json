My baby is 11 months old and is breastfed. He has had a cough with phlegm and clear nasal discharge for the past two days, but no fever.

Yesterday, I noticed that my child's phlegm and nasal discharge have increased, and he is not eating or drinking well. Two days ago, he was still eating and drinking, but now he wakes up crying after sleeping for only two hours at night.

Last Wednesday, my daughter had a slight runny nose and a bit of nasal mucus. It improved slightly afterwards. On Saturday morning, she received the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine in Hong Kong. In the afternoon, my daughter said the injection site was painful, as if it was more severe, and she cried for a long time. She couldn't touch the injection site, and I noticed that it was slightly swollen. That night, she had a slight fever when sleeping, but her body temperature was normal at around 37 degrees Celsius and she didn't sweat. She slept restlessly, tossing and turning, and was a bit fussy. In the second half of the night, she started sweating and slept better. The next day, she had red rashes on her lower back, thighs, and feet, and she started to have a runny nose and cough. Yesterday (Tuesday), the rashes on her body had noticeably subsided. In the morning, she had a bit of clear nasal mucus and still had some nasal mucus. The cough had worsened. She coughed more frequently in the morning and evening, and felt a bit of phlegm. During the day, her temperature was slightly higher, but there were no major issues. She temporarily didn't have a stuffy nose when sleeping at night, but she would cough a bit in the second half of the night, although it hasn't affected her sleep yet. About a month ago, she had allergic coughing for about 20 days. I don't know if this time it's also allergic or caused by rhinitis. The time when the cough worsens every day is similar to last time, but not as severe. It also worsened after receiving the vaccine, so I'm not sure if it's an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Doctor, how should I handle this? Yesterday, I gave her some lung tonic, and we have hydrochloride cetirizine drops at home, but I haven't given it to her.
