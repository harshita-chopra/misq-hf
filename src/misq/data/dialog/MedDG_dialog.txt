Acute appendicitis: initially pain around the navel, then shifting to right lower abdomen pain. Examination may reveal tenderness and rebound tenderness in the right lower abdomen. Blood tests, physical examination, and appendiceal ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis. 4. Urinary tract stones: symptoms include back pain, groin pain, continuous colicky pain that is unbearable and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Urinalysis and urinary tract ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis. 5. Gastrointestinal perforation: may have a history of peptic ulcer disease, physical examination may reveal tenderness throughout the abdomen, muscle tension, and a board-like abdomen.

{"id": "Doctor", "Sentence": "阑尾炎如果没有化脓，需要抗菌消炎处理。请问你下午回家，有带上医生开的消炎药吗？绝大多数急性阑尾炎一旦确诊，应早期施行阑尾切除术。早期手术系指阑尾炎症还处于管腔阻塞或仅有充血水肿时就手术切除，此时手术操作较简易，术后并发症少。如化脓坏疽或穿孔后再手术，不但操作困难且术后并发症会明显增加。术前即应用抗生素，有助于防止术后感染的发生。", "Sentence_en": "If appendicitis does not suppurate, it needs to be treated with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory drugs. When you go home this afternoon, did you bring the anti-inflammatory medication prescribed by the doctor? For the vast majority of acute appendicitis cases, once diagnosed, early appendectomy should be performed. Early surgery refers to the surgical removal of the appendix when the inflammation is still in the stage of luminal obstruction or only congestion and edema, making the operation relatively simple and with fewer postoperative complications. If surgery is performed after suppuration or perforation, not only is the operation difficult, but postoperative complications will significantly increase. The use of antibiotics before surgery can help prevent postoperative infections."}

How long has this situation been going on? Have you lost weight? Have you had thyroid function tests done? Your current situation requires thyroid function tests to rule out hyperthyroidism, as well as a colonoscopy to rule out conditions such as colon ulcers, polyps, and tumors. Irritable bowel syndrome is a problem with regulating intestinal function, so it can recur. Symptoms typically include constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or a combination of these. Various factors, including emotions such as anger, depression, anxiety, and stress, can trigger it; staying up late, fatigue, and certain foods like alcohol, spicy, and cold foods can also trigger it; exposure to cold can also trigger it; insomnia, excessive worrying, and stress can also cause this condition to recur. The diagnosis of the disease must rule out organic diseases such as ulcers, tumors, polyps, and hyperthyroidism. In today's environment where colon tumors are becoming increasingly common among young people, it is recommended that both young and elderly individuals undergo a colonoscopy to rule out organic diseases before considering this diagnosis. If you have had thyroid function tests done, ruled out hyperthyroidism, and had a colonoscopy with no issues, and the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is relatively clear, the following treatments can be considered: removing triggers, avoiding spicy and cold foods, and taking medication. Medications that can be considered include: Pivmecillinam tablets, three times a day, one tablet each time (50mg); Pefacon capsules, twice a day, two capsules each time (420mg); removing triggers is the most important step."}

Irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome is a problem with the regulation of intestinal function, so it can recur. Usually, symptoms manifest as constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or a combination of these three symptoms appearing simultaneously or intermittently. However, various factors, including emotions such as anger, depression, anxiety, and stress, can trigger it; staying up late, fatigue, and certain foods like alcohol, spicy, and cold foods can also trigger it; exposure to cold can also easily trigger it; insomnia, excessive worrying, overthinking, and high stress can also cause this condition to recur. The diagnosis of the disease must rule out organic diseases, such as ulcers, tumors, polyps, hyperthyroidism, and so on. In today's environment where colorectal cancer is becoming increasingly common among young people, it is recommended that both young and elderly individuals undergo a colonoscopy to rule out organic diseases before considering this diagnosis. If you have had a colonoscopy and there are no issues, and the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome is relatively clear, the following treatments can be considered: removing triggers, avoiding spicy and cold foods, and taking medication. Medications that can be taken include mebeverine tablets, three times a day, one tablet each time (50mg); and peppermint oil capsules, twice a day, two capsules each time (420mg). Removing triggers is the most crucial aspect of treatment."}

He has been exclusively formula-fed since birth. When he was around 20 days old, he had severe diarrhea. The doctor prescribed probiotics and recommended diarrhea formula milk. He initially took Saccharomyces boulardii powder, then later took Bifidobacterium lactis triple live bacteria powder, along with switching to diarrhea formula milk, which helped stop the diarrhea. After about a month of taking the diarrhea formula milk, he switched back to regular formula milk improperly, which caused another bout of diarrhea. He then resumed the diarrhea formula milk and probiotics, which helped stop the diarrhea, but he continued to have green stools. Only recently did his stools start to become yellow-green. During this time, I consulted with a doctor who said it may be due to the high iron content in the formula milk and not a major issue. It has been over two months now without any further episodes of diarrhea. His height and weight are normal. \n\nOn the 6th, around 4 am, he suddenly had diarrhea again. The stool was not very watery, but looser than usual, and yellow in color. Normally, he has a bowel movement every two to three days, occasionally once a day. I felt he might have a slight case of diarrhea, so I gave him some probiotics. The next day, he had two bowel movements, which were normal, so I did not continue giving him probiotics. However, on the 8th, around 1 am, he had a slight bout of diarrhea again, so I resumed giving him probiotics. On the 9th, he had one bowel movement, which was normal, and I have continued giving him probiotics. Early this morning, around 4 am, he had another bowel movement, which was a bit loose. \n\nDuring this time, his energy levels have been good, and his milk intake is normal, just slightly more than usual.

Medication can help remove excessive feces from the distal rectum; for example, when experiencing difficulty passing stool, you can use a rectal enema to lubricate the stool.

Although you are currently in a weight loss period, water, vegetables, and fruits are essential for the body. If you eat and drink less, it can lead to dry stools and constipation, which is not conducive to your weight loss! In addition, chili peppers can also cause dry stools and even lead to bleeding hemorrhoids, so you must stop consuming them recently. As for the reason for your current bleeding, I think there are two possibilities that are more likely. One is that dry stools cause local mucosal damage around the anus, leading to bleeding, and the other is that there may be hemorrhoids, especially internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, I suggest that you control your diet recently, keep your stools moist and smooth, and see if there is still bleeding. If there is repeated bleeding, you need to have a proctology examination to determine the location and cause of the bleeding."}
